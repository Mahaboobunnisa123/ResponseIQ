The **ResponseIQ Chatbot** is a Python-based conversational AI system designed to handle real-time interactions.  
It provides two modes of interaction:  

1. **Streamlit Web UI** — clean and interactive interface for end-users.  
2. **Console UI** — text-based interaction with enhanced formatting using `rich`.  

The project demonstrates:
- NLP-based conversational design.  
- Multi-interface deployment.  
- Clear project documentation and results.
